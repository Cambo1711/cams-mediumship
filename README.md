20:26
anything at all did you get on with him much or Yeah I used to talk to him he was all right but tell me about what he
20:32
was like oh he was just uh he was pretty dirty in what way wasn't that clean yeah and the
20:39
house was pretty feral had chooks living in it and yeah chickens living in his house yeah we
20:44

20:50
tip bag and tip cut a hole in the fence and bring it back here yeah but um none of your kids were allowed over there why
20:57
not well just the way he was just the stories what stories well
21:04
that he was a pedophile has the police ever spoken to you yeah about detectives about Frank yeah on the phone what were
21:11
they saying they just asked me about him same thing I'm telling you same thing yeah and then they never came back after
21:17
that yeah okay the police who spoke to Frank's old
21:22
neighbor were detectives from the strike force investigating the disappearance of William Tier but they only called him he
21:31
says they never visited in person sitting on his front porch I looked next
21:37
door at Frank Abbott's old house someone new lives there now since Frank moved
21:43
out and there were more cars on the front lawn a little boat a tiny up on a trailer and what looks like a black
21:50
stone gargoyle of some kind of winged mythical creature beside the screen door
21:56
hi mate i look over at all of that and I think all right it's worth a visit
22:03
uh let's have another knock cuz we chat to him before the screen door is shut but the main
22:09
door behind it is open and I can see it's dark inside the house although it's
22:14
late morning almost midday i'm pretty sure we wake the owner
22:20
up my name is Dan i'm sorry to bother you on a Sunday morning the man comes to the doorway scratching
22:26
himself in shirtless wearing only shorts and he's big muscular he's got tattoos
22:32
across his body but he's friendly how long did you know him for
22:39
not long as said we bought this place the man invites us in come see
22:48
how long you been here for he says he's lived here since 2010
22:53
four years before William was reported missing this place we sit down in a
22:58
lounge room dominated by a long black sofa and a big noisy fish tank inside
23:06
the man starts talking about how they took over the house from Frank Abbott i
23:11
think we've done about 13 loads 13 loads of rubbish from the backyard what kind of rubbish i mean everything washing
23:18
machines over in this corner there was like I don't know steel
23:23
bathtubs over in that corner scrap metal and bits things things you could sell
23:28
maybe yeah i don't know about selling them but
23:34
Yeah and that's even now like you go out there you could dig the dirt and you'll
23:39
still find [ __ ] in the dirt like that it was that thick what was it like inside
23:44
the house very dark and gloomy like the bathroom was basically rotted out sort of thing
23:52
in the bathroom yeah like all you know the walls inside the floor and that it
23:57
was very like old and it was one of these houses where you could you know was 50/50 you could push it down and
24:04
start building again or you could start renovating yeah so we chose to renovate it
24:11
and was it clean it was very old and dusty inside and then stuff that was
24:19
inside it was like you can say antique furniture but he he got it from out the
24:26
front of someone's house or whatever like it wasn't proper you know what I mean so it was old furniture not so much
24:32
antique as old and it had been thrown away yeah yeah tell me about Frank
24:38
himself what was he like you talked to him and that like straight
24:44
up i just assume it's another old bike you know a bit bit funny in his
24:49
ways but then once you've heard the stories and
24:54
stuff like from people around town and even from his um his
25:01
brother named Bluey that was his nickname Bluey even he had nothing nice
25:07
to say about him what stories did you hear about Fred well I heard about
25:12
um I don't know like who it was at the time but it was young girls and young
25:19
boys um something about he took them out to the forest out here this one here and
25:27
um but tied them up to trees what yeah
25:32
tied them up the trees and dude I can't I'm not going to sit here and and make
25:37
up something that I don't know i'm just saying he tied him up the trees and did something bad out there did you hear
25:44
anything else yeah well Frank was um
25:50
basically like creeped around any any girl he'd be on to
25:57
him one story this man tells us we hear more than once in John's River from
26:03
other people who knew Frank but I'm not going to repeat it not because we don't
26:10
think that story is true but because we fear it might be and I don't want to
26:17
identify the people involved
26:23
um I was saying didn't really have any hate or anything towards him cuz I
26:29
said there all stories you know and that he's always wandering around town and and making out he was going to get a
26:36
lift to help out someone or like cleaning or something for people but
26:44
anyway that's as much as I knew him like "Yeah how you doing?" Like and then he stopped in here once or twice like even
26:51
a couple times more and um me dad my dad's giving him a lift like he was
26:57
always hunting for a lift to the shops or something so that's as much as we
27:02
knew of him like you just you give him a lift be nice you know don't [ __ ]
27:09
be nice don't [ __ ] with Frank Abbott and give him a lift if you see him soon
27:15
after this mention of his dad giving Frank Abbott a lift the man's father walks into the lounge room behind us
27:22
it's me Dad he'll he might have a thing to say anyway how you doing i walk over
27:28
and introduce myself my name is Dan we're um
27:34
journalists this is colleague of mine Ne they're doing um a a story a a news
27:41
thing on Frank Abbott oh Frankie boy yes you can sit down and
27:47
have a chat in a minute whatever like go have a cigarette and
27:52
cuz me dad knew him just as much as I did so we swap over the first man goes
27:59
outside to the front yard of the house to smoke a cigarette and we're left there sitting in the lounge room on the
28:05
big black sofa talking to his father
28:10
you knew Frank Albert for how long
28:16
since we moved up here 2010
28:21
how would you describe him
28:28
dirty i drove down to old bar once and Frank would always
28:35
bum a ride put it on to you to offer him a lift
28:42
he says he gave Frank a lift to Oldbar which is another little town about a
28:47
halfhour drive south along the highway where the Manning River flows out between two long empty beaches to the
28:54
ocean he had a job there to do with cutting a woman's
29:00
lawn i dropped them at the house and I said "Frank how long?" Because I wanted
29:07
to have a look around i'll b myself and he said "Oh a couple of hours." I said
29:14
"Well if you're going to be that long I'll pick you up." Like um so I come
29:19
back and picked him up and I was astounded what he said to me
29:25
he said um this woman's got heaps of money in the
29:32
house and he didn't actually say it in words but he wanted to me
29:41
to come in with him to rob her and I thought what a low person he is like um
29:48
everything about him was shifted
29:53
there's no proof Frank was thinking of robbing that woman but so far in John's
29:59
River I've heard so many different stories about Frank that this one
30:04
doesn't surprise me um did you ever hear Frank
30:12
say anything that he might have done worse than stealing this time the answer
30:18
does surprise me yeah it's um his brother Bluey is a nice boat
30:26
frank's brother Jeffrey whose nickname was Bluey because he had orange hair
30:32
apparently it's an Australian thing go figure anyway Blueie he died in 2020
30:38
quite a few years back now but um he always
30:45
said when the stories are going around with till that he didn't do it and he
30:52
didn't do it and right pretty close to when he
31:00
died but he said to my son he said he did do
31:06
it he said "And he's buried up on Big
31:14
Bird Mountain there where that big tree is." Big bird they got a sign on there
31:22
and um yeah I thought that was a turn around
31:28
from Blueie saying that because he wanted to like his brother
31:35
but he didn't you could see it in that he didn't like him wait stop as the
31:43
older man is saying this I'm trying to process what we're hearing
31:49
so the story goes Bluey was Frank's brother and apparently Blueie used to
31:55
say Frank was not involved in William Tier's disappearance except right up just
32:03
before he died Blueie said to this man's son Frank was
32:09
involved he did and Williams buried up on Big Bird
32:15
Mountain is buried up on Big
32:20
Bird Mountain there where there's some kind of big tree where that big
32:28
trees big bird they got a sign on there later we'll discover there's this big
32:36
tree outside of John's River called the bird tree which is this giant black butt
32:42
tree it's about 70 or so meters high and 11 meters around the trunk and everyone
32:49
who lives on the midn north coast apparently knows this tree other members
32:54
of Frank Abbott's family will tell us they used to visit it as children the bird tree stands on the slopes of Middle
33:02
Brother which is a mountain up on Big
33:08
Bird Mountain there
33:14
but where my brain starts to do loops is when we learn that the bird tree is next
33:21
to another giant black butt called Beneroon which is the same name as the
33:27
road where William Tur was reported missing Beneroon Drive and when I Google
33:32
the bird tree a state government website says you get there via Betar Creek Road
33:40
which is the road leading to Beneroon Drive most of that area is forest a
33:48
national park named after the Middle Brother Mountain and we learn that the morning after William is reported
33:54
missing at 9:22 a.m frank Abbott's mobile phone pings off the middle
34:02
brother cell tower which is described in evidence before the inquest as covering
34:09
the Kendall area so the area around the town where
34:14
William was reported missing but that Kendall area it's a huge chunk of land looking at a map it
34:22
must be dozens of square kilometers of mostly empty forest farmland and dirt
34:29
roads so this mobile phone ping doesn't actually prove anything except that
34:36
Frank is likely somewhere in that area but right now in this conversation with
34:44
the old man inside what used to be Frank Abbott's house in the town of John's
34:49
River I'm thinking why bring this up we haven't even asked you about William i'm
34:58
also thinking none of this is evidence in court a judge would dismiss it and
35:04
call it hearsay it's just a story told by one person who says they heard it
35:11
from another it proves nothing and I'm not suggesting it's true far from it but
35:18
sitting here listening to this man say what his son said that Blueie told him
35:25
yeah no I thought that was a turn around from Bluey i'm thinking we really need
35:33
to talk to your son
35:41
we might just go and ask your son about what you've just told us about Blueie
35:46
the old man seems relaxed and jokes that we should remind his son to mow the lawn
35:51
while we're out there telling me you got to do the grass i will i'm not getting
35:57
back to work soon i think he's just waiting for it to get too hot again so we bundle up our recording kit and head
36:03
out of the house when he says something
36:11
only I'm distracted and miss it and later listening back it's hard to hear because the microphone's bumping as we
36:18
hurry out the front to where his son is smoking he
36:23
probably didn't he probably forgot about that but I
36:29
didn't forget about it he changed his version
36:35
with his brother the way he changed his version with his brother meaning Frank
36:42
and his brother Blueie no one ever checked that out he
36:48
must have told quite a few people that story
36:54
no one ever checked that out and he must have told quite a few
36:59
people that story but Blue is dead so he can't tell us if he really said
37:07
that later we ask Frank about this in writing in a letter we sent to him in
37:13
prison but we haven't heard back cuz he died right after that do you remember
37:19
when he died blue yeah oh it's got to be 8 years
37:25
since then so the best thing we can do right now is go outside to the front of the house
37:31
where the old man's son is smoking next to the front porch and an unused lawn
37:37
mower hey mate your dad's got a message for you
37:43
can you mow the lawn yeah just we got to finish the lawn hey there was one thing
37:49
he said though which uh I wanted to ask you about and maybe it just slipped your mind he said about Bluey at this point
37:57
the wind outside the house starts blowing sorry can we just move slightly this way oh yeah sure thing wind a bit
38:02
yeah i can see Nina frowning the wind makes it hard to record what someone's
38:07
saying do you want to go inside yeah can we just Sorry sorry
38:14
we go inside the house and crowd together in the kitchen there's a TV playing in the background yeah you're
38:20
right your dad was talking about Frank's brother Blueie and he was also saying
38:25
that you remember that little lad William Troll went missing flipping Kendall he said afterwards Blueie would
38:32
always say Frank didn't do it cuz it was in the news that Frank had been looked at by the inquest was that right from
38:40
memory i remember him saying that he doesn't like he didn't believe Frank had
38:45
anything to do with it but then at the same time he'd sit down too so I haven't got anything nice to say about him man
38:51
and then your dad said that before Blueie died he came to you and he he may
38:57
have said something different no I can't remember that i don't Blue
39:04
didn't say anything about maybe Frank could have done it not that I Not that I remember or that
39:12
William may have been buried up on is it Big Bird Hill
39:18
oh no no no no like um Louie was always u like he was the
39:26
only one that basically of his family that he didn't really have contact but
39:32
um he used to hear the stuff that was going on because he was the first part of the family and and there was another
39:37
brother who lived in Queensland so uh Blueie used to hear the stories of
39:43
what's going on with Frank through his brother in Queensland and so just from them stories that Blue
39:51
used to hear like um he'd he'd sometimes pass on to us like Blue Transfer and
39:57
message not messages but just talk that's happening through what's happening at court yeah he's getting
40:03
charged with this and stuff like that but I know he did say something like he
40:09
didn't believe that Frank was guilty but he also said
40:14
that I think it's under the belief that Frank needed the jail time like cuz what
40:20
he's done in his past sort of makes up for it if you know what I mean yeah so he deserved to be in jail cuz of things
40:26
he'd done in his past yeah yeah so it's been a while so I can't really That's all right thanks for clearing that up
40:32
for us though yeah no we'll get out your hair thanks thank you have a good one
40:38
good luck with the launch yeah good luck with the lawn nina and I walk out of Frank's old house into the sun thinking
40:43
about this story of the bird tree i'm convinced it's just that a story and
40:51
even if Blueie really said that which I doubt then who's to say it wasn't Blue
40:57
himself who was involved and trying to shift attention to Frank his brother
41:04
we get in our car and drive off outside John's River on the highway we pass a
41:10
turning with a road sign pointing to the bird tree and we ignore it we just keep
41:16
on driving
41:27
then weeks later Nino and I are back in John's River still working on this
41:33
podcast and we pull up again outside Frank's old house the older man is
41:39
sitting outside on the front deck just going to record yeah
41:44
i walk up and he says "Hello." The conversation goes straight back to
41:50
Frank Abbott and his brother Blueie he's changed his mind a bit who's that his
41:57
brother Bluey yeah the old man waves me over to a metal gate beside the house
42:07
that's Bluey's dog behind it is a big old dog that reminds
42:12
me of a blood hound and the old man says that was Bluey's dog how did you end up
42:19
with Bluey's dog we We've got six dogs here you got six dogs yeah and love dogs love animals
42:29
so did you get Bluey's dog after Blueie died or died before he died he had to go
42:35
in the T be close to the hospital right
42:40
walking back to the front verander the old man sits at the table and I pull up a toolbox to sit on with him i'll sit on
42:47
this i realize his memory isn't perfect he sometimes loses track of what he's
42:54
saying i lost training oh we he trails off i
42:59
don't know what was what was I just saying there you said you went down to the bowling but on one thing he's
43:05
insistent fate did do it that's the words I heard
43:11
from my son what told him did do it and he's buried up there
43:19
on his bird somewhere when you say big bird you mean the bird tree
43:26
yeah that mountain just Yeah if you go up the top of the mountain and you look down on top of here it's beautiful yeah
43:34
um and that's the words and I couldn't get over that because I
43:42
still haven't found him when your son came and told
43:47
you about Blueie saying that about Frank did you think "Oh we should do
43:54
something with that we should tell
44:04
someone oh I don't know he doesn't really answer it sounded like Lou just
44:11
give up defending him or something like that
44:17
and that's that's what I heard we asked your son about if Blueie said
44:23
that to him and he said he couldn't remember
44:28
how he would have said it was um I remember
44:35
like tight lipped or shut your mouth
44:40
i remember tight lipped or shut your mouth he tells us then the old man's son
44:46
arrives driving onto the front lawn he gets out angry shirtless again and walks
44:52
across the grass towards us shouting saying he doesn't want to talk about
44:57
Frank Abbott and waving at us to get away and get out so we get
45:04
out we've been in John's River long enough we reckon and this time driving
45:11
away again we pass the sign for the bird tree and keep driving it's probably
45:18
nothing we'll tell the police but I'm thinking about something the younger man
45:24
the son told us when we spoke to him the first time and asked him about whether
45:30
Frank Abbott's brother Blueie told him something about William Tur and his
45:36
reply was "I don't remember." I know he did say something like he
45:43
didn't believe it frank was guilty blueie didn't believe that Frank was
45:49
guilty of anything to do with William but he also said that
45:55
I think it's under the belief that Frank needed the jail time like what he's done in his past sort of makes up for it but
46:03
Blueie was under the belief Frank needed jail time to make up for what Frank had
46:10
done in his past which makes me ask the question what did
46:17
Frank do and that's when Nina and I start
46:22
looking at the young woman who disappeared and where Frank was found
46:27
not guilty she was riding a push bike I think it
46:33
was and uh yeah and he picked her up and threw them i think he said he had a ute
46:39
and what did he say he did with the push bike i I think he did dump it so he he
46:44
picked her up with her bike maybe put the bike in the back of the ute apparently and then did he tell you what
46:51
happened next that's next time on Witness William
